        <h1>Lumiwrks Song Submission Guidelines</h1>
        <br><br>
      
        <h2>1. Song Format:</h2>
        <p>
          We accept song submissions in digital format only. Please provide a link to a file-sharing service (e.g., Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.) or SoundCloud (private link) where we can listen to your song. Ensure that the link/file is accessible and remains active until the review process is complete.
        </p>

        <br>
      
        <h2>2. Genres:</h2>
        <p>
          Lumiwrks focuses on specific genres, including (but not limited to) electronic, ambient, indie, and experimental music. We are particularly interested in unique and innovative sounds within these genres.
        </p>
      
        <br>

        <h2>3. Originality:</h2>
        <p>
          Submit only original compositions. Your submission should not infringe upon any copyright or intellectual property rights of others. Plagiarized or unauthorized sampled works will not be considered.
        </p>

        <br>
      
        <h2>4. Submission Details:</h2>
        <p>
          Provide accurate and complete information about the song and yourself. Include the song title, artist/band name, contact information (email), and any relevant social media handles or website links.
        </p>

        <br>
      
        <h2>5. Bio and Press Kit:</h2>
        <p>
          Optionally, you can include a brief artist/band biography and a press kit with your submission. This helps us understand your background, achievements, and promotional materials, which may increase the chances of your song being considered.
        </p>

        <br>
      
        <h2>6. Sound Quality:</h2>
        <p>
          Ensure that your song has a good sound quality and production value. Although we appreciate creativity, excessively low-quality or poorly mixed/mastered recordings may hinder the evaluation process.
        </p>

        <br>
      
        <h2>7. Multiple Submissions:</h2>
        <p>
          You may submit multiple songs, but please send each song as a separate submission. This allows us to assess each song individually. This excludes albums.
        </p>

        <br>
      
        <h2>8. Rights and Permissions:</h2>
        <p>
          By submitting your song to Lumiwrks, you confirm that you own all the necessary rights to the composition and recording. You grant Lumiwrks the right to review and evaluate your song for potential signing, without any obligation on our part.
        </p>

        <br>
      
        <h2>9. Follow-Up Communication:</h2>
        <p>
          In the event that we are interested in your submission, we will contact you using the provided contact information. Please refrain from follow-up emails or inquiries about the status of your submission unless a considerable amount of time has passed.
